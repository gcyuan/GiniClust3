## GiniClust3
###GiniClust3: a fast and memory-efficient tool for rare cell type identification
GiniClust is a clustering method specifically designed for rare cell type detection. It uses the Gini index to identify genes that are associated with rare cell types without prior knowledge. This differs from traditional clustering methods using highly variable genes. Using a cluster-aware, weighted consensus clustering approach, we can combine the outcomes fro
